# Project's Title:
- Cafe_total_stock_value


# Project Description:
- We can calculate the total stock worth by looping through the menu list, 
and for each item, multiply its stock value by its price.

- This small project example is about to show how to use dictionaries and within a simple for loop,
we can have a taste of a program that can be implemented in a large business,
we might need to bring some codes to connect a big data base but even how big it could be,
still we will use the same for loop.


# Expectation:
- I expect this program to improve in a near future to calculate more than just dictionaries,
nevertheless this is the crucial logic base for itself.
