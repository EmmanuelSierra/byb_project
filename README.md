# Project's Title:
Cafe_total_stock_value

# Project Description:
We can calculate the total stock worth by looping through the menu list, 
and for each item, multiply its stock value by its price.


This small project example is about to show how to use dictionaries and within a simple for loop,
we can have a taste of a program that can be implemented in a large business,
we might need to bring some codes to connect a big data base but even how big it could be,
still we will use the same for loop.


I expect this program to improve in a near future,
nevertheless this is the crucial logic base for itself.
